# Open-Source-Final-Project-
We have developed a sophisticated customer bank account management system that encompasses the following processes:

1. Account Creation: To facilitate the account creation process, we have implemented a function that allows customers to input their essential personal information, including their name, national ID, date of birth, email, phone number, and more. Upon submission of the provided details, the system automatically generates a unique Registration ID for each customer.

2. Account Information Update: For the second option, we have incorporated a function that empowers customers to update their existing information within the system. This functionality enables users to modify details such as phone numbers, email addresses, and other relevant information.

3. Transaction Management: Our system provides a robust method, implemented in a shell script, that allows customers to view and manage their transactions, including deposits and withdrawals. By entering their Registration ID, customers gain access to a comprehensive interface for monitoring and controlling their financial activities.

4. Information Retrieval: To offer enhanced convenience, we have implemented a method that enables users to retrieve and view their complete account information. By entering their assigned Registration ID, customers can access a comprehensive overview of their existing details stored within the system.

5. Account Deletion: We understand that circumstances may require customers to close their accounts. Therefore, our system features an option that permits users to delete their accounts from the entire system. This functionality ensures a seamless experience for customers who no longer wish to maintain their banking relationship.

6. Menu Exit: Lastly, our system incorporates an option that allows users to exit the menu gracefully. By selecting this option, customers can conclude their interaction with the system straightforwardly and efficiently.

With these advanced features, our customer bank account management system provides a comprehensive and user-friendly platform for efficient account creation, information management, transaction monitoring, and account closure.
